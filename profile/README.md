# 🌍 AI Holistic View

**AI Holistic View** is a community-driven initiative exploring **Artificial Intelligence from multiple dimensions** — research, engineering, education, creativity, and real-world impact.

We believe that AI is more than coding models.  
It is **a system of knowledge** that connects mathematics, science, engineering, ethics, philosophy, and human imagination.

This GitHub organization is our collaborative space to **build, research, learn, and share**.
